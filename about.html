    <h2> What are handloom fabrics?</h2>
<p align="justify">Handloom fabrics are handwoven fabrics created on a weaving device called a loom. The process involves entwining a set of vertical threads, the ‘warp”, with a set of horizontal threads, the ‘weft”.

<br>The loom holds the warp threads under tension to facilitate the interweaving of the weft threads over and above the warp using a weaving shuttle. This is done repeatedly to create the handloom fabric.</p>

<p>Handloom weaving is a labour of love as much as it’s a source of livelihood. It requires utmost patience, artistry, and technical skills not to mention physical strength!

The weaver’s hand is at the heart of this intricate process. They select the yarn, pattern, colour, texture, and precise technique to create their desired aesthetic.

The fabric carries the energy and personality of the weaver and it becomes part of the garment’s story.</p>


<h2>Handloom Fabrics - Final thoughts</h2>
<p align="justify">Although the practice of handloom is viewed as a fading art, there’s still hope for the future of the industry.<br> There have been initiatives over the years that have increased the visibility and viability of the craft.

<br>Social media awareness campaigns through popular hashtags such as #IloveHandloom and #vocalforhandloom have ignited interest in handloom fabrics especially among Millennials and Gen Zs.

<br>The Indian government has also declared August 7th the National Handloom Day to celebrate the extraordinary skills of weavers and encourage people to buy the handloom products.

<br>With the growing demand for sustainable fashion around the world, the handloom industry can play a big role in that transition.

<br>Handlooms are more than just fabrics, they’re monuments that carry so much history, culture and heritage that’s worth preserving.

<br>They’re a wonderful thing to have in this overly homogenized world!
<br>Handloom provides a source of livelihood for many rural communities. In India, the industry is the second-largest employer after agriculture.<br> Remarkably, 77% of weavers are women and handloom allows them to be economically independent and self-sufficient.
